# BTT_SFS_2_CoPrint3D_Smart_Runout_Sensor
These are the macros for Klipper to make the CoPrint3D system work with the Big Tree Tech Smart Filament Sensor 2.0

The files that need to be added to your 3D printer are  
motion.cfg  
runout.cfg  
extruders.cfg  
save_variables.cfg  
  
These files (see below) have data that needs to be added and/or changed in the appropriate sections:  
printer.cfg  
ecm_1.cfg  
kcm.cfg  
drivers.cfg  
cp_macro.cfg  
  
You will add your runout or motion sensor pins in the runout.cfg or the motion.cfg file.
